        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="updated">Last updated: February 25, 2026</p>

        <p>Gamarjoba ("we", "our", or "us") is operated by Gamarjoba Group LLC, registered at apt. 28, 13 Vazha Pshavela Avenue, Tbilisi 0160, Georgia. We operate the Gamarjoba mobile application (the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains what personal data we collect, how we use it, who we share it with, and how you can exercise your rights.</p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

        <h3>1.1 Account &amp; Profile Information</h3>

            <li>Location data is used to show you nearby users, events, and venues. Other users can see your relative closeness but your exact coordinates or distance are <strong>never</strong> shared.</li>
            <li>Location updates <strong>stop automatically</strong> when the App is in the background.</li>
            <li>Users whose location has not been updated for more than 10 minutes are automatically hidden from nearby results.</li>

            <li>We store your verification status and the selfie image for dispute resolution purposes.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.5 Device &amp; Technical Data</h3>
